Task 1: Create Public API
1. Create an endpoint lapi/v1/books which would return the books list (only confirmed
books), with pagination done by Laravel standards
2. Every book should return those fields: id, title, cover full URL, price, authors as string
comma-separated, genres as string comma-separated
3. You need to use Laravel API Resources for this
4. Create an endpoint for a single book lapi/v1/books/{id} and show the fields the
same as in the list but also add Description field. But you need to use the same
Laravel API Resource, just with the condition of when to add the description field or
not.
